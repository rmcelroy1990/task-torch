**TaskTorch** is a short-term task board designed for entrepreneurs, freelancers, and busy professionals who need to outsource help fast. Users can post one-off tasks (1–7 days) and receive offers or comments from others interested in completing them. The platform makes it easy to organize and connect small business needs — whether it's organizing files, running errands, or providing technical support.

## 🚀 Why TaskTorch?

As small businesses grow, many entrepreneurs face micro-task overload. I built **TaskTorch** to provide a lightweight, easy-to-use platform that connects these individuals with short-term help. The goal is to "light up your to-do list" by sparking quick connections strong enough to move the needle forward.
